# Particle-Tracing-Earth

The single particle simulation for the wave-particle interaction simulation was made in Python and from Stelios Tourgaidis.
It was converted first in C++ to increase the performance and to parallelize the execution in a hybrid way (with OpenMP and MPI).

To understand better the code structure, a flow diagram that also leads to the corresponding GitHub modules has been created.
