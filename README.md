Here's an improved version with some changes to the syntax:

"This repository contains the code developed for my thesis titled 'Simulation of Wave-Particle Interaction using Parallel Processing.' This work was carried out during my studies in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the Democritus University of Thrace.

The initial simulation for wave-particle interaction was implemented in Python by Stelios Tourgaidis. It was later translated into C++ and parallelized to simulate multiple particles.

To address the challenges of interacting with waves and handling a large population of particles, the following features were implemented:

    Different methods for generating particle distributions
    Hybrid HPC implementation using both distributed and shared memory models (MPI and OpenMP)
    Utilization of the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) for storing simulation data
    Enhanced visualization of particle distributions throughout the simulation using matplotlib.

To better understand the code structure, a flow diagram has been created. You can download the following PDF documents to access their hyperlinks and explore the corresponding GitHub modules:

    Particle_distribution.pdf"d

I made a few changes to enhance clarity and readability, including rephrasing certain sentences and improving punctuation.
